### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Albert, an engineer (student, finishing my end of degree thesis) working in the astrophysical data validation sector. Currently I am not actively looking for any job position, however, I will gladly take a look at any offer you send me!

### What is this place? ðŸ¤”

This is my own profile, where my projects with no projection of going public go. Even the projects that are public will not be published for the intention of public use. Pull requests and/or suggestion are absolutely welcome.

### Contact ðŸ“«

My networks can be found [here](https://linktr.ee/as43z) and you can send a mail to [albertsaeznunez@gmail.com](mailto://albertsaeznunez@gmail.com). Please be mindful of your comments and be patient as I have many things to attend to right now.
